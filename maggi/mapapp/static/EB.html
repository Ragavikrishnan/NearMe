    The EB (Electricity Board) office in our village stands as a hub of power management, ensuring that homes and businesses are lit up 
with the flick of a switch. Located conveniently within our community, the office is where locals go to address electrical concerns, 
set up new connections, or report outages. With its approachable staff and neat surroundings, the EB office is a place where the pulse
of our village's power supply is monitored and maintained. It serves as a crucial link between the residents and the seamless flow of 
electricity, ensuring that lights stay on and appliances hum with life in our quaint corner of the world.
