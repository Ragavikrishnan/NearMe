Mangalore, my village, is a coastal gem that unfolds the beauty of simple living. With its palm-fringed beaches, bustling markets, 
and the welcoming chatter of its people, Mangalore encapsulates a blend of tradition and modernity. The aroma of fresh seafood mingles 
with the fragrances of jasmine and incense as one navigates the vibrant streets. From the iconic temples to the rhythmic beats of 
traditional folk music, the essence of Mangalore lies in its cultural richness. Surrounded by lush greenery and bordered by the gentle 
waves of the Arabian Sea, the village offers a tranquil retreat for both residents and visitors alike. In Mangalore, every corner tells 
a story, and every sunrise brings a promise of another day steeped in the charm of coastal life.
